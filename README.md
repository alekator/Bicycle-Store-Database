# Project - Bicycle Store Database

## Description
This project represents the development of a database for storing and managing information about bicycles. The database includes tables for storing data about bicycles, suppliers, manufacturers, and other reference data. It supports data entry, editing, and viewing, and provides role-based access control for users: operator, user, and administrator.

## Key Features
**The project implements the following functionalities:**
- Data entry, editing, and viewing for bicycles.
- Use of reference tables and related tables.
- Support for user roles: operator, user, and administrator.
- Execution of various queries for data analysis about bicycles.

## Queries
